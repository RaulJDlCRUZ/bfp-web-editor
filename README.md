# BFP Web Editor (BWE)
> [!NOTE]
> _This online platform is part of my Bachelorâ€™s Final Project (TFG)_

BFP Web Editor, or **BWE**, is an online platform that allows users to manage, modify, and create TFG documents in a simple and user-friendly manner. Currently, these activities are carried out manually using the command line interface to modify text documents and execute scripts. This platform will allow all these procedures to be carried out accessibly through the Internet, thus avoiding downtime for the user related to the completion of the regulations for the preparation of the document or report for the Final Degree Project. The obtained or expected product is a web application whose main characteristic is its usability, which will allow students to create and manage their dissertation reports easily, in order to focus their time on the development of their TFG reports, rather than on their format.
